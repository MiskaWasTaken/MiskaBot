# Miska Bot

## Welcome to the "maintained" code of Miska Bot

## How to setup

**DONT EVER USE NPM IT WILL BREAK EVERYTHING**
1. Install yarn on a different terminal (npm i yarn -g)
2. run 'yarn start'
3. fill up config.ts
4. copy 'simply-djs-v13' from 'custom modules' to 'node modules'
5. run 'yarn start'
6. If you see logged in as *botName* then you were succesful 

If you get any errors with yarn installing the modules, switch the yarn version to latest (https://yarnpkg.com/cli/set/version/)
